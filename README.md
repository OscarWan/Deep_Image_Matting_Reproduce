# Deep_Image_Matting_Reproduce
This is my CS capstone at undergraduate level about Deep Image Matting (DIM). Basically, the current plan includes:

1. Reproduce the algorithm deep image matting by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03872)
2. (Optional) If possible, try to reproduce the reviced version of [High-resolution DIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06613).
3. Try possible improvements with encoder-decoder structure.
4. Try to replace CNN model in the paper to other models.
